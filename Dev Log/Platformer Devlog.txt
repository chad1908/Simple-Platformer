************************************



2021-04-23
- Added a basic movement that allows the player to move around the scene

2021-04-24
- Improved on the basic movement adding the ability to incrementally jump based on how long the jump button is pressed
- Also worked on the air control to make it feel smoother.
- Added a script that will be attached to the camera and will force a camera to follow the player
	- Added a tracking speed variable player to become offset from the center of the camera (this simply gives it a nice effect) 
		

2021-04-25
- Worked on getting the player to teleport to a new spawn location in the same scene when the player reaches the goal.
	-setup a basic goal that sends the player to a spawn object when the collider on the goal is triggered.

-Added a hazard script that can be attached to any gameobject the player will be destroyed by
	-Right now the only thing the script is attatcheds to is the water, so when the player collides with the water the player sprite is destroyed

-Added a death particle that will be triggered when the player object is destroyed.

-Added a run animation for the main character.
-Added a jump animation for the main character.

2021-04-26
-Added code to the hazard script that swaps the player sprite with a death particle that shoots red pixels in a cone upwards.

-updated the movement script to have smoother air control, previously the player would keep the same momentum no matter what movement they used.
The movement is now a lot smoother and the player looses speed while in the air.

-Added the functionality to jump off of walls, this took a bit of tweaking to get working properly but gives a nice feel.

-setup new test stage to test the wall jumping and make sure it feels nice.


2021-04-29
- Started mapping the first level
	-Laid out some signs that will later be the tutorial for the game (each sign will have different information to help the player progress)

2021-04-30
-Finished a base layout for the first level which will act as a tutorial level
-Stated working on the second
	-This level will follow a different theme than the first level and will slightly increase in difficulty.

2021-05-11
-Added the camera follow script to the second level, and attached the player.
	-This will make it so when the player spawns in the second level the camera will still follow the player.

-continued on the second level design
	-Added more challenging obstacles.

- Added a friction material to the player prefab.
	- When on walls the player would slide off very fast so this material allows the player to have more time to react when doing wall jumps.

- Added a new sign sprite that will be used to give the player a sense of direction when it may not be obvious.

2021-05-12
- Added a parallax script that will scroll the background when the player is moving in the game to give a nice look.

2021-05-13
- Made the background image longer by duplicating it and then repeating it to ensure it covers the whole level.

2021-05-14
- Added a pickup script that will attached to objects that will give the player a power up.

- Added a dash ability to the player.
	-this will be activated by the pickup.

2021-05-17
- Changed the pickup script name to dashAbility
	- This change was made as the script will only give the player the ability to dash.

- Added a bool that controls whether the player has the ability to dash, the player can obtain the dash by grabbing the pickup in the game scene.

2021-05-19
-Added IdleAnimation
-Added SlidingAnimation

-Added a new section to level 1 that will show the player how to use the dash ability and requires it to continue through the level.
	-Added new terrain to the level for aesthetics.

-Changed the dash ability to disable after one use to avoid ability spam.

-Made a boundaries script that will be used to make boundaries that the player cannot pass, this will help prevent the player from falling off the level.

2021-05-28
-Added a game manager that only has the functionality to respawn the player at the moment.
	-the game manager checks what scene the player is currently on and on death the level is restarted.

2021-05-31
-Added a new spike prefab that will be used as a hazard in the game

-Continued on level 2 level design.

2021-06-03
- Added a new dash particle that gives the players dash a bit more of a flashy look
	-Rigged the particles to only spawn and play when the player dashes.

-discovered a bug that allows the player to jump off of hazard objects that should kill the player on collision
	-Fixed the bug by setting the players jump to 0 when collising with a hazard object, this allows time for the player object to be destroyed

-Added a Main menu scene as a temporary placeholder.

2021-06-07
- Added a new button sprite for any menus in the game.

- Added a play button to the main menu that starts the game on the main scene.

	-Dart trap which is a simple base to indicate the trap
	-Arrow sprite which will be shot out of the dart trap

2021-06-13
-Made an arrowSpawner prefab that spawns arrows and shoots them in a certain direction.
	-After a short delay the arrows that were spawned are destroyed.

2021-06-15
-Changed the font I was using with a new one that I found on the Unity asset store

-Added a box collider to tutorial signs that activates a text object when the player enters the collider
	-Made a text prefab that shows when the player enters the collider.

2021-06-16
-Added more tutorial signs to the first level to help guide the player.

-Added a test build folder so I could check for any potential issues when building the game.

2021-06-17
-Continued level design for level 2
	-Added a slight expansion to level 2 that makes the player think a bit more about their movement.

-Changed the code that sets the players jump to 0 when colliding with a boundary object to reset the jump back to the normal value after they touch the ground.

2021-06-21
- Basic level design for level 2.

-Worked on a way to add a delay to the arrow trap so it does not shoot as soon as the player enters the trigger
	-Got the delay before the first shot working but the co-routine does not have a way to exit properly and gets stuck, I have a on trigger exit to stop the shooting but it does not seem to work.

2021-06-22
-Found A way to stop the arrow trap from continuously shooting by adding another co-rotuine that stops the shooting with a delay slightly longer than the shooting method to ensure the first shot is fired.

-Tried fixing a bug that allows the player to jump on triggers in the scene, unfortunately I have not found a fix yet.

2021-06-23
-Added a new section to level 1

2021-07-05
-Added a new section to level 2 that is a little more challenging than any other section so far. This section uses a combination of the arrow trap and spikes trap so the player has to time their jumps.

-Cleaned up level design for level 2 to give it a more uniform and clean look.

2021-07-15
